    '''Calculates building re-occupancy and function based on simulations of
    building damage and calculates the recovery times of each recovery state
    based on a given repair schedule
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    damage: dictionary
     contains per damage state damage, loss, and repair time data for each 
     component in the building
    building_model: dictionary
     general attributes of the building model
    damage_consequences: dictionary
     data structure containing simulated building consequences, such as red
     tags and repair costs ratios
    utilities: dictionary
     data structure containing simulated utility downtimes
    functionality_options: dictionary
     recovery time optional inputs such as various damage thresholds
    tenant_units: DataFrame
     attributes of each tenant unit within the building
    subsystems: DataFrame
     attributes of building subsystems; data provided in static tables
     directory
    
    Returns
    -------
    recovery['reoccupancy']: dictionary
     contains data on the recovery of tenant- and building-level reoccupancy, 
     recovery trajectorires, and contributions from systems and components 
    recovery['functional']: dictionary
     contains data on the recovery of tenant- and building-level function, 
     recovery trajectorires, and contributions from systems and components'''
