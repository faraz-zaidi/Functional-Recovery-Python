    Parameters
    ----------
    damage: dictionary
     contains per damage state damage, loss, and repair time data for each 
     component in the building
    damage_consequences: dictionary
     data structure containing simulated building consequences, such as red
     tags and repair costs ratios
    utilities: dictionary
     data structure containing simulated utility downtimes
    building_model: dictionary
     general attributes of the building model
    subsystems: DataFrame
     data table containing information about each subsystem's attributes
    reoccupancy: dictionary
     contains data on the recovery of tenant- and building-level function, 
     recovery trajectorires, and contributions from systems and components 
    functionality_options: dictionary
     recovery time optional inputs such as various damage thresholds
    tenant_units: DataFrame
     attributes of each tenant unit within the building
    impeding_temp_repairs: dictionary
     contains simulated temporary repairs the impede occuapancy and function
     but are calulated in parallel with the temp repair schedule
    
    Returns
    -------
    functionality: dictionary
     contains data on the recovery of tenant- and building-level function, 
     recovery trajectorires, and contributions from systems and components'''
